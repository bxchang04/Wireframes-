#TO-DO

- One should be able to drop an element 'approximatively' into a smaller one (over 50% of dropzone is covered by dragelement)

- Accessible dragNdrop

- Be able to provide css selectors (at least for the dropzones) instead of elements with an option to "update" elements on every click (= refreshing the selection, can be handy if new dropzones are added after initialisation)

(not 100% sure if goo idea:)
- One should be able to set "drag" and "drop" to elements separately: 
that the drag elements are not bound to the drop elements &
that they both have a separate drop callback but can also work together.
(dropzone centered vs dragelement centered)
OR by providing .classnames so that dropZones are not fix once set
